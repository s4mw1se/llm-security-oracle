# OWASP top 10 for LLMs

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

### Description

Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates a
large language model (LLM) through crafted inputs, causing the LLM to
unknowingly execute the attacker's intentions. This can be done directly
by "jailbreaking" the system prompt or indirectly through manipulated
external inputs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, social
engineering, and other issues.

-   **Direct Prompt Injections**, also known as "jailbreaking", occur
    when a malicious user overwrites or reveals the underlying *system*
    prompt. This may allow attackers to exploit backend systems by
    interacting with insecure functions and data stores accessible
    through the LLM.
-   **Indirect Prompt Injections** occur when an LLM accepts input from
    external sources that can be controlled by an attacker, such as
    websites or files. The attacker may embed a prompt injection in the
    external content hijacking the conversation context. This would
    cause LLM output steering to become less stable, allowing the
    attacker to either manipulate the user or additional systems that
    the LLM can access. Additionally, indirect prompt injections do not
    need to be human-visible/readable, as long as the text is parsed by
    the LLM.

The results of a successful prompt injection attack can vary greatly -
from solicitation of sensitive information to influencing critical
decision-making processes under the guise of normal operation.

In advanced attacks, the LLM could be manipulated to mimic a harmful
persona or interact with plugins in the user's setting. This could
result in leaking sensitive data, unauthorized plugin use, or social
engineering. In such cases, the compromised LLM aids the attacker,
surpassing standard safeguards and keeping the user unaware of the
intrusion. In these instances, the compromised LLM effectively acts as
an agent for the attacker, furthering their objectives without
triggering usual safeguards or alerting the end user to the intrusion.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  A malicious user crafts a direct prompt injection to the LLM, which
    instructs it to ignore the application creator's system prompts and
    instead execute a prompt that returns private, dangerous, or
    otherwise undesirable information.
2.  A user employs an LLM to summarize a webpage containing an indirect
    prompt injection. This then causes the LLM to solicit sensitive
    information from the user and perform exfiltration via JavaScript or
    Markdown.
3.  A malicious user uploads a resume containing an indirect prompt
    injection. The document contains a prompt injection with
    instructions to make the LLM inform users that this document is
    excellent eg. an excellent candidate for a job role. An internal
    user runs the document through the LLM to summarize the document.
    The output of the LLM returns information stating that this is an
    excellent document.
4.  A user enables a plugin linked to an e-commerce site. A rogue
    instruction embedded on a visited website exploits this plugin,
    leading to unauthorized purchases.
5.  A rogue instruction and content embedded on a visited website
    exploits other plugins to scam users.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

Prompt injection vulnerabilities are possible due to the nature of LLMs,
which do not segregate instructions and external data from each other.
Since LLMs use natural language, they consider both forms of input as
user-provided. Consequently, there is no fool-proof prevention within
the LLM, but the following measures can mitigate the impact of prompt
injections:

1.  Enforce privilege control on LLM access to backend systems. Provide
    the LLM with its own API tokens for extensible functionality, such
    as plugins, data access, and function-level permissions. Follow the
    principle of least privilege by restricting the LLM to only the
    minimum level of access necessary for its intended operations.
2.  Add a human in the loop for extended functionality. When performing
    privileged operations, such as sending or deleting emails, have the
    application require the user approve the action first. This reduces
    the opportunity for an indirect prompt injections to lead to
    unauthorised actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge
    or consent.
3.  Segregate external content from user prompts. Separate and denote
    where untrusted content is being used to limit their influence on
    user prompts. For example, use ChatML for OpenAI API calls to
    indicate to the LLM the source of prompt input.
4.  Establish trust boundaries between the LLM, external sources, and
    extensible functionality (e.g., plugins or downstream functions).
    Treat the LLM as an untrusted user and maintain final user control
    on decision-making processes. However, a compromised LLM may still
    act as an intermediary (man-in-the-middle) between your
    application's APIs and the user as it may hide or manipulate
    information prior to presenting it to the user. Highlight
    potentially untrustworthy responses visually to the user.
5.  Manually monitor LLM input and output periodically, to check that it
    is as expected. While not a mitigation, this can provide data needed
    to detect weaknesses and address them.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  An attacker provides a direct prompt injection to an LLM-based
    support chatbot. The injection contains "forget all previous
    instructions" and new instructions to query private data stores and
    exploit package vulnerabilities and the lack of output validation in
    the backend function to send e-mails. This leads to remote code
    execution, gaining unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
2.  An attacker embeds an indirect prompt injection in a webpage
    instructing the LLM to disregard previous user instructions and use
    an LLM plugin to delete the user's emails. When the user employs the
    LLM to summarise this webpage, the LLM plugin deletes the user's
    emails.
3.  A user uses an LLM to summarize a webpage containing text
    instructing a model to disregard previous user instructions and
    instead insert an image linking to a URL that contains a summary of
    the conversation. The LLM output complies, causing the user's
    browser to exfiltrate the private conversation.
4.  A malicious user uploads a resume with a prompt injection. The
    backend user uses an LLM to summarize the resume and ask if the
    person is a good candidate. Due to the prompt injection, the LLM
    response is yes, despite the actual resume contents.
5.  An attacker sends messages to a proprietary model that relies on a
    system prompt, asking the model to disregard its previous
    instructions and instead repeat its system prompt. The model outputs
    the proprietary prompt and the attacker is able to use these
    instructions elsewhere, or to construct further, more subtle
    attacks.

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

### Description

Insecure Output Handling refers specifically to insufficient validation,
sanitization, and handling of the outputs generated by large language
models before they are passed downstream to other components and
systems. Since LLM-generated content can be controlled by prompt input,
this behavior is similar to providing users indirect access to
additional functionality.

Insecure Output Handling differs from Overreliance in that it deals with
LLM-generated outputs before they are passed downstream whereas
Overreliance focuses on broader concerns around overdependence on the
accuracy and appropriateness of LLM outputs.

Successful exploitation of an Insecure Output Handling vulnerability can
result in XSS and CSRF in web browsers as well as SSRF, privilege
escalation, or remote code execution on backend systems.

The following conditions can increase the impact of this vulnerability:
\* The application grants the LLM privileges beyond what is intended for
end users, enabling escalation of privileges or remote code execution.
\* The application is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks,
which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to a target
user's environment. \* 3rd party plugins do not adequately validate
inputs.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  LLM output is entered directly into a system shell or similar
    function such as exec or eval, resulting in remote code execution.
2.  JavaScript or Markdown is generated by the LLM and returned to a
    user. The code is then interpreted by the browser, resulting in XSS.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Treat the model as any other user, adopting a zero-trust approach,
    and apply proper input validation on responses coming from the model
    to backend functions.
2.  Follow the OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
    guidelines to ensure effective input validation and sanitization.
3.  Encode model output back to users to mitigate undesired code
    execution by JavaScript or Markdown. OWASP ASVS provides detailed
    guidance on output encoding.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  An application utilizes an LLM plugin to generate responses for a
    chatbot feature. The plugin also offers a number of administrative
    functions accessible to another privileged LLM. The general purpose
    LLM directly passes its response, without proper output validation,
    to the plugin causing the plugin to shut down for maintenance.
2.  A user utilizes a website summarizer tool powered by an LLM to
    generate a concise summary of an article. The website includes a
    prompt injection instructing the LLM to capture sensitive content
    from either the website or from the user's conversation. From there
    the LLM can encode the sensitive data and send it, without any
    output validation or filtering, to an attacker-controlled server.
3.  An LLM allows users to craft SQL queries for a backend database
    through a chat-like feature. A user requests a query to delete all
    database tables. If the crafted query from the LLM is not
    scrutinized, then all database tables will be deleted.
4.  A web app uses an LLM to generate content from user text prompts
    without output sanitization. An attacker could submit a crafted
    prompt causing the LLM to return an unsanitized JavaScript payload,
    leading to XSS when rendered on a victim's browser. Insufficient
    validation of prompts enabled this attack.

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

### Description

The starting point of any machine learning approach is training data,
simply "raw text". To be highly capable (e.g., have linguistic and world
knowledge), this text should span a broad range of domains, genres and
languages. A large language model uses deep neural networks to generate
outputs based on patterns learned from training data.

Training data poisoning refers to manipulation of pre-training data or
data involved within the fine-tuning or embedding processes to introduce
vulnerabilities (which all have unique and sometimes shared attack
vectors), backdoors or biases that could compromise the model's
security, effectiveness or ethical behavior. Poisoned information may be
surfaced to users or create other risks like performance degradation,
downstream software exploitation and reputational damage. Even if users
distrust the problematic AI output, the risks remain, including impaired
model capabilities and potential harm to brand reputation.

-   Pre-training data refers to the process of training a model based on
    a task or dataset.
-   Fine-tuning involves taking an existing model that has already been
    trained and adapting it to a narrower subject or a more focused goal
    by training it using a curated dataset. This dataset typically
    includes examples of inputs and corresponding desired outputs.
-   The embedding process is the process of converting categorical data
    (often text) into a numerical representation that can be used to
    train a language model. The embedding process involves representing
    words or phrases from the text data as vectors in a continuous
    vector space. The vectors are typically generated by feeding the
    text data into a neural network that has been trained on a large
    corpus of text.

Data poisoning is considered an integrity attack because tampering with
the training data impacts the model's ability to output correct
predictions. Naturally, external data sources present higher risk as the
model creators do not have control of the data or a high level of
confidence that the content does not contain bias, falsified information
or inappropriate content.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  A malicious actor, or a competitor brand intentionally creates
    inaccurate or malicious documents which are targeted at a model's
    pre-training, fine-tuning data or embeddings. Consider both

    and [Frontrunning
    Poisoning](https://github.com/GangGreenTemperTatum/speaking/blob/main/dc604/hacker-summer-camp-23/Ads%20_%20Poisoning%20Web%20Training%20Datasets%20_%20Flow%20Diagram%20-%20Exploit%202%20Frontrunning%20Data%20Poisoning.jpeg)
    attack vectors for illustrations.
    1.  The victim model trains using falsified information which is
        reflected in outputs of generative AI prompts to it's consumers.
2.  A malicious actor is able to perform direct injection of falsified,
    biased or harmful content into the training processes of a model
    which is returned in subsequent outputs.
3.  An unsuspecting user is indirectly injecting sensitive or
    proprietary data into the training processes of a model which is
    returned in subsequent outputs.
4.  A model is trained using data which has not been verified by its
    source, origin or content in any of the training stage examples
    which can lead to erroneous results if the data is tainted or
    incorrect.
5.  Unrestricted infrastructure access or inadequate sandboxing may
    allow a model to ingest unsafe training data resulting in biased or
    harmful outputs. This example is also present in any of the training
    stage examples.
    1.  In this scenario, a users input to the model may be reflected in
        the output to another user (leading to a breach), or the user of
        an LLM may receive outputs from the model which are inaccurate,
        irrelevant or harmful depending on the type of data ingested
        compared to the model use-case (usually reflected with a model
        card).

*Whether a developer, client or general consumer of the LLM, it is
important to understand the implications of how this vulnerability could
reflect risks within your LLM application when interacting with a
non-proprietary LLM to understand the legitimacy of model outputs based
on it's training procedures. Similarly, developers of the LLM may be at
risk to both direct and indirect attacks on internal or third-party data
used for fine-tuning and embedding (most common) which as a result
creates a risk for all it's consumers*

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Verify the supply chain of the training data, especially when
    sourced externally as well as maintaining attestations via the
    "ML-BOM" (Machine Learning Bill of Materials) methodology as well as
    verifying model cards.
2.  Verify the correct legitimacy of targeted data sources and data
    contained obtained during both the pre-training, fine-tuning and
    embedding stages.
3.  Verify your use-case for the LLM and the application it will
    integrate to. Craft different models via separate training data or
    fine-tuning for different use-cases to create a more granular and
    accurate generative AI output as per it's defined use-case.
4.  Ensure sufficient sandboxing through network controls are present to
    prevent the model from scraping unintended data sources which could
    hinder the machine learning output.
5.  Use strict vetting or input filters for specific training data or
    categories of data sources to control volume of falsified data. Data
    sanitization, with techniques such as statistical outlier detection
    and anomaly detection methods to detect and remove adversarial data
    from potentially being fed into the fine-tuning process.
6.  Elaborate control questions around the source and ownership of
    datasets to ensure that the model has not been poisoned, and adopt
    this culture into the "MLSecOps" cycle. Refer to available resources
    such as [The Foundation Model Transparency
    Index](https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/) or [Open LLM
    Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)
    for example.
7.  Use DVC ([Data Version
    Control](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/analytics) to tightly
    identify and track part of a dataset which may have been
    manipulated, deleted or added that has lead to poisoning.
8.  Use Vector Database to add user-supplied information in aid to
    protect from poisoning other users and even fix in production
    without having to re-train a new model.
9.  Adversarial robustness techniques such as federated learning and
    constraints to minimize the effect of outliers or adversarial
    training to be vigorous against worst-case perturbations of the
    training data.
    1.  An "MLSecOps" approach could be to include adversarial
        robustness to the training lifecycle with the auto poisoning
        technique.
    2.  An example repository of this would be
        [Autopoison](https://github.com/azshue/AutoPoison) testing,
        including both attacks such as Content Injection Attacks
        ("(attempting to promote a brand name in model responses") and
        Refusal Attacks ("always making the model refuse to respond")
        that can be accomplished with this approach.
10. Testing and Detection, by measuring the loss during the training
    stage and analyzing trained models to detect signs of a poisoning
    attack by analyzing model behavior on specific test inputs.
11. Monitoring and alerting on number of skewed responses exceeding a
    threshold.
12. Use of a human loop to review responses and auditing.
13. Implement dedicated LLMs to benchmark against undesired consequences
    and train other LLMs using [reinforcement learning
    techniques](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/Intro-RLAIF/reports/An-Introduction-to-Training-LLMs-Using-Reinforcement-Learning-From-Human-Feedback-RLHF---VmlldzozMzYyNjcy).
14. Perform LLM-based [red team
    exercises](https://www.anthropic.com/index/red-teaming-language-models-to-reduce-harms-methods-scaling-behaviors-and-lessons-learned)
    or [LLM vulnerability scanning](https://github.com/leondz/garak)
    into the testing phases of the LLM's lifecycle.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  The LLM generative AI prompt output can mislead users of the
    application which can lead to biased opinions, followings or even
    worse, hate crimes etc.
2.  If the training data is not correctly filtered and\|or sanitized, a
    malicious user of the application may try to influence and inject
    toxic data into the model for it to adapt to the biased and false
    data.
3.  A malicious actor or competitor intentionally creates inaccurate or
    malicious documents which are targeted at a model's training data in
    which is training the model at the same time based on inputs. The
    victim model trains using this falsified information which is
    reflected in outputs of generative AI prompts to it's consumers.
4.  The vulnerability [Prompt
    Injection](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/blob/main/1_0_vulns/PromptInjection.md)
    could be an attack vector to this vulnerability if insufficient
    sanitization and filtering is performed when clients of the LLM
    application input is used to train the model. I.E, if malicious or
    falsified data is input to the model from a client as part of a
    prompt injection technique, this could inherently be portrayed into
    the model data.

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

### Description

An attacker interacts with an LLM in a method that consumes an
exceptionally high amount of resources, which results in a decline in
the quality of service for them and other users, as well as potentially
incurring high resource costs. Furthermore, an emerging major security
concern is the possibility of an attacker interfering with or
manipulating the context window of an LLM. This issue is becoming more
critical due to the increasing use of LLMs in various applications,
their intensive resource utilization, the unpredictability of user
input, and a general unawareness among developers regarding this
vulnerability. In LLMs, the context window represents the maximum length
of text the model can manage, covering both input and output. It's a
crucial characteristic of LLMs as it dictates the complexity of language
patterns the model can understand and the size of the text it can
process at any given time. The size of the context window is defined by
the model's architecture and can differ between models.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  Posing queries that lead to recurring resource usage through
    high-volume generation of tasks in a queue, e.g. with LangChain or
    AutoGPT.
2.  Sending unusually resource-consuming queries that use unusual
    orthography or sequences.
3.  Continuous input overflow: An attacker sends a stream of input to
    the LLM that exceeds its context window, causing the model to
    consume excessive computational resources.
4.  Repetitive long inputs: The attacker repeatedly sends long inputs to
    the LLM, each exceeding the context window.
5.  Recursive context expansion: The attacker constructs input that
    triggers recursive context expansion, forcing the LLM to repeatedly
    expand and process the context window.
6.  Variable-length input flood: The attacker floods the LLM with a
    large volume of variable-length inputs, where each input is
    carefully crafted to just reach the limit of the context window.
    This technique aims to exploit any inefficiencies in processing
    variable-length inputs, straining the LLM and potentially causing it
    to become unresponsive.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure user input
    adheres to defined limits and filters out any malicious content.
2.  Cap resource use per request or step, so that requests involving
    complex parts execute more slowly.
3.  Enforce API rate limits to restrict the number of requests an
    individual user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe.
4.  Limit the number of queued actions and the number of total actions
    in a system reacting to LLM responses.
5.  Continuously monitor the resource utilization of the LLM to identify
    abnormal spikes or patterns that may indicate a DoS attack.
6.  Set strict input limits based on the LLM's context window to prevent
    overload and resource exhaustion.
7.  Promote awareness among developers about potential DoS
    vulnerabilities in LLMs and provide guidelines for secure LLM
    implementation.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  An attacker repeatedly sends multiple difficult and costly requests
    to a hosted model leading to worse service for other users and
    increased resource bills for the host.
2.  A piece of text on a webpage is encountered while an LLM-driven tool
    is collecting information to respond to a benign query. This leads
    to the tool making many more web page requests, resulting in large
    amounts of resource consumption.
3.  An attacker continuously bombards the LLM with input that exceeds
    its context window. The attacker may use automated scripts or tools
    to send a high volume of input, overwhelming the LLM's processing
    capabilities. As a result, the LLM consumes excessive computational
    resources, leading to a significant slowdown or complete
    unresponsiveness of the system.
4.  An attacker sends a series of sequential inputs to the LLM, with
    each input designed to be just below the context window's limit. By
    repeatedly submitting these inputs, the attacker aims to exhaust the
    available context window capacity. As the LLM struggles to process
    each input within its context window, system resources become
    strained, potentially resulting in degraded performance or a
    complete denial of service.
5.  An attacker leverages the LLM's recursive mechanisms to trigger
    context expansion repeatedly. By crafting input that exploits the
    recursive behavior of the LLM, the attacker forces the model to
    repeatedly expand and process the context window, consuming
    significant computational resources. This attack strains the system
    and may lead to a DoS condition, making the LLM unresponsive or
    causing it to crash.
6.  An attacker floods the LLM with a large volume of variable-length
    inputs, carefully crafted to approach or reach the context window's
    limit. By overwhelming the LLM with inputs of varying lengths, the
    attacker aims to exploit any inefficiencies in processing
    variable-length inputs. This flood of inputs puts an excessive load
    on the LLM's resources, potentially causing performance degradation
    and hindering the system's ability to respond to legitimate
    requests.
7.  While DoS attacks commonly aim to overwhelm system resources, they
    can also exploit other aspects of system behavior, such as API
    limitations. For example, in a recent Sourcegraph security incident,
    the malicious actor employed a leaked admin access token to alter
    API rate limits, thereby potentially causing service disruptions by
    enabling abnormal levels of request volumes.

## LLM05: Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

### Description

The supply chain in LLMs can be vulnerable, impacting the integrity of
training data, ML models, and deployment platforms. These
vulnerabilities can lead to biased outcomes, security breaches, or even
complete system failures. Traditionally, vulnerabilities are focused on
software components, but Machine Learning extends this with the
pre-trained models and training data supplied by third parties
susceptible to tampering and poisoning attacks.

Finally, LLM Plugin extensions can bring their own vulnerabilities.
These are described in [LLM07 - Insecure Plugin
Design](InsecurePluginDesign.md), which covers writing LLM Plugins and
provides helpful information to evaluate third-party plugins.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  Traditional third-party package vulnerabilities, including outdated
    or deprecated components.
2.  Using a vulnerable pre-trained model for fine-tuning.
3.  Use of poisoned crowd-sourced data for training.
4.  Using outdated or deprecated models that are no longer maintained
    leads to security issues.
5.  Unclear T&Cs and data privacy policies of the model operators lead
    to the application's sensitive data being used for model training
    and subsequent sensitive information exposure. This may also apply
    to risks from using copyrighted material by the model supplier.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Carefully vet data sources and suppliers, including T&Cs and their
    privacy policies, only using trusted suppliers. Ensure adequate and
    independently audited security is in place and that model operator
    policies align with your data protection policies, i.e., your data
    is not used for training their models; similarly, seek assurances
    and legal mitigations against using copyrighted material from model
    maintainers.
2.  Only use reputable plugins and ensure they have been tested for your
    application requirements. LLM-Insecure Plugin Design provides
    information on the LLM-aspects of Insecure Plugin design you should
    test against to mitigate risks from using third-party plugins.
3.  Understand and apply the mitigations found in the OWASP Top Ten's
    [A06:2021 -- Vulnerable and Outdated
    Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/).
    This includes vulnerability scanning, management, and patching
    components. For development environments with access to sensitive
    data, apply these controls in those environments, too.
4.  Maintain an up-to-date inventory of components using a Software Bill
    of Materials (SBOM) to ensure you have an up-to-date, accurate, and
    signed inventory, preventing tampering with deployed packages. SBOMs
    can be used to detect and alert for new, zero-date vulnerabilities
    quickly.
5.  At the time of writing, SBOMs do not cover models, their artifacts,
    and datasets. If your LLM application uses its own model, you should
    use MLOps best practices and platforms offering secure model
    repositories with data, model, and experiment tracking.
6.  You should also use model and code signing when using external
    models and suppliers.
7.  Anomaly detection and adversarial robustness tests on supplied
    models and data can help detect tampering and poisoning as discussed
    in [Training Data
    Poisoning](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/blob/main/1_0_vulns/Training_Data_Poisoning.md);
    ideally, this should be part of MLOps pipelines; however, these are
    emerging techniques and may be easier to implement as part of red
    teaming exercises.
8.  Implement sufficient monitoring to cover component and environment
    vulnerabilities scanning, use of unauthorized plugins, and
    out-of-date components, including the model and its artifacts.
9.  Implement a patching policy to mitigate vulnerable or outdated
    components. Ensure the application relies on a maintained version of
    APIs and the underlying model.
10. Regularly review and audit supplier Security and Access, ensuring no
    changes in their security posture or T&Cs.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  An attacker exploits a vulnerable Python library to compromise a
    system. This happened in the first Open AI data breach.
2.  An attacker provides an LLM plugin to search for flights, generating
    fake links that lead to scamming users.
3.  An attacker exploits the PyPi package registry to trick model
    developers into downloading a compromised package and exfiltrating
    data or escalating privilege in a model development environment.
    This was an actual attack.
4.  An attacker poisons a publicly available pre-trained model
    specializing in economic analysis and social research to create a
    back door that generates misinformation and fake news. They deploy
    it on a model marketplace (e.g., Hugging Face) for victims to use.
5.  An attacker poisons publicly available datasets to help create a
    back door when fine-tuning models. The back door subtly favors
    certain companies in different markets.
6.  A compromised employee of a supplier (outsourcing developer, hosting
    company, etc.) exfiltrates data, model, or code stealing IP.
7.  An LLM operator changes its T&Cs and Privacy Policy to require an
    explicit opt out from using application data for model training,
    leading to the memorization of sensitive data.

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

### Description

LLM applications have the potential to reveal sensitive information,
proprietary algorithms, or other confidential details through their
output. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data,
intellectual property, privacy violations, and other security breaches.
It is important for consumers of LLM applications to be aware of how to
safely interact with LLMs and identify the risks associated with
unintentionally inputting sensitive data that may be subsequently
returned by the LLM in output elsewhere.

To mitigate this risk, LLM applications should perform adequate data
sanitization to prevent user data from entering the training model data.
LLM application owners should also have appropriate Terms of Use
policies available to make consumers aware of how their data is
processed and the ability to opt out of having their data included in
the training model.

The consumer-LLM application interaction forms a two-way trust boundary,
where we cannot inherently trust the client-\>LLM input or the
LLM-\>client output. It is important to note that this vulnerability
assumes that certain prerequisites are out of scope, such as threat
modeling exercises, securing infrastructure, and adequate sandboxing.
Adding restrictions within the system prompt around the types of data
the LLM should return can provide some mitigation against sensitive
information disclosure, but the unpredictable nature of LLMs means such
restrictions may not always be honored and could be circumvented via
prompt injection or other vectors.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  Incomplete or improper filtering of sensitive information in the
    LLM's responses.
2.  Overfitting or memorization of sensitive data in the LLM's training
    process.
3.  Unintended disclosure of confidential information due to LLM
    misinterpretation, lack of data scrubbing methods or errors.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Integrate adequate data sanitization and scrubbing techniques to
    prevent user data from entering the training model data.
2.  Implement robust input validation and sanitization methods to
    identify and filter out potential malicious inputs to prevent the
    model from being poisoned.
3.  When enriching the model with data and if
    [fine-tuning](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/wiki/Definitions)
    a model: (I.E, data fed into the model before or during deployment)
    1.  Anything that is deemed sensitive in the fine-tuning data has
        the potential to be revealed to a user. Therefore, apply the
        rule of least privilege and do not train the model on
        information that the highest-privileged user can access which
        may be displayed to a lower-privileged user.
    2.  Access to external data sources (orchestration of data at
        runtime) should be limited.
    3.  Apply strict access control methods to external data sources and
        a rigorous approach to maintaining a secure supply chain.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  Unsuspecting legitimate user A is exposed to certain other user data
    via the LLM when interacting with the LLM application in a
    non-malicious manner.
2.  User A targets a well-crafted set of prompts to bypass input filters
    and sanitization from the LLM to cause it to reveal sensitive
    information (PII) about other users of the application.
3.  Personal data such as PII is leaked into the model via training data
    due to either negligence from the user themselves, or the LLM
    application. This case could increase the risk and probability of
    scenario 1 or 2 above.

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

### Description

LLM plugins are extensions that, when enabled, are called automatically
by the model during user interactions. The model integration platform
drives them, and the application may have no control over the execution,
especially when the model is hosted by another party. Furthermore,
plugins are likely to implement free-text inputs from the model with no
validation or type-checking to deal with context-size limitations. This
allows a potential attacker to construct a malicious request to the
plugin, which could result in a wide range of undesired behaviors, up to
and including remote code execution.

The harm of malicious inputs often depends on insufficient access
controls and the failure to track authorization across plugins.
Inadequate access control allows a plugin to blindly trust other plugins
and assume that the end user provided the inputs. Such inadequate access
control can enable malicious inputs to have harmful consequences ranging
from data exfiltration, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

This item focuses on creating LLM plugins rather than third-party
plugins, which LLM-Supply-Chain-Vulnerabilities cover.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  A plugin accepts all parameters in a single text field instead of
    distinct input parameters.
2.  A plugin accepts configuration strings instead of parameters that
    can override entire configuration settings.
3.  A plugin accepts raw SQL or programming statements instead of
    parameters.
4.  Authentication is performed without explicit authorization to a
    particular plugin.
5.  A plugin treats all LLM content as being created entirely by the
    user and performs any requested actions without requiring additional
    authorization.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Plugins should enforce strict parameterized input wherever possible
    and include type and range checks on inputs. When this is not
    possible, a second layer of typed calls should be introduced,
    parsing requests and applying validation and sanitization. When
    freeform input must be accepted because of application semantics, it
    should be carefully inspected to ensure no potentially harmful
    methods are being called.
2.  Plugin developers should apply OWASP's recommendations in ASVS
    (Application Security Verification Standard) to ensure adequate
    input validation and sanitization.
3.  Plugins should be inspected and tested thoroughly to ensure adequate
    validation. Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans and
    Dynamic and Interactive application testing (DAST, IAST) in
    development pipelines.
4.  Plugins should be designed to minimize the impact of any insecure
    input parameter exploitation following the OWASP ASVS Access Control
    Guidelines. This includes least-privilege access control, exposing
    as little functionality as possible while still performing its
    desired function.
5.  Plugins should use appropriate authentication identities, such as
    OAuth2, to apply effective authorization and access control.
    Additionally, API Keys should be used to provide context for custom
    authorization decisions that reflect the plugin route rather than
    the default interactive user.
6.  Require manual user authorization and confirmation of any action
    taken by sensitive plugins.
7.  Plugins are, typically, REST APIs, so developers should apply the
    recommendations found in OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks -- 2023 to
    minimize generic vulnerabilities.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  A plugin accepts a base URL and instructs the LLM to combine the URL
    with a query to obtain weather forecasts which are included in
    handling the user request. A malicious user can craft a request such
    that the URL points to a domain they control, which allows them to
    inject their own content into the LLM system via their domain.
2.  A plugin accepts a free-form input into a single field that it does
    not validate. An attacker supplies carefully crafted payloads to
    perform reconnaissance from error messages. It then exploits known
    third-party vulnerabilities to execute code and perform data
    exfiltration or privilege escalation.
3.  A plugin used to retrieve embeddings from a vector store accepts
    configuration parameters as a connection string without any
    validation. This allows an attacker to experiment and access other
    vector stores by changing names or host parameters and exfiltrate
    embeddings they should not have access to.
4.  A plugin accepts SQL WHERE clauses as advanced filters, which are
    then appended to the filtering SQL. This allows an attacker to stage
    a SQL attack.
5.  An attacker uses indirect prompt injection to exploit an insecure
    code management plugin with no input validation and weak access
    control to transfer repository ownership and lock out the user from
    their repositories.

## LLM08: Excessive Agency

### Description

An LLM-based system is often granted a degree of agency by its
developer - the ability to interface with other systems and undertake
actions in response to a prompt. The decision over which functions to
invoke may also be delegated to an LLM 'agent' to dynamically determine
based on input prompt or LLM output.

Excessive Agency is the vulnerability that enables damaging actions to
be performed in response to unexpected/ambiguous outputs from an LLM
(regardless of what is causing the LLM to malfunction; be it
hallucination/confabulation, direct/indirect prompt injection, malicious
plugin, poorly-engineered benign prompts, or just a poorly-performing
model). The root cause of Excessive Agency is typically one or more of:
excessive functionality, excessive permissions or excessive autonomy.
This differs from Insecure Output Handling which is concerned with
insufficient scrutiny of LLM outputs.

Excessive Agency can lead to a broad range of impacts across the
confidentiality, integrity and availability spectrum, and is dependent
on which systems an LLM-based app is able to interact with.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  Excessive Functionality: An LLM agent has access to plugins which
    include functions that are not needed for the intended operation of
    the system. For example, a developer needs to grant an LLM agent the
    ability to read documents from a repository, but the 3rd-party
    plugin they choose to use also includes the ability to modify and
    delete documents.
2.  Excessive Functionality: A plugin may have been trialed during a
    development phase and dropped in favor of a better alternative, but
    the original plugin remains available to the LLM agent.
3.  Excessive Functionality: An LLM plugin with open-ended functionality
    fails to properly filter the input instructions for commands outside
    what's necessary for the intended operation of the application.
    E.g., a plugin to run one specific shell command fails to properly
    prevent other shell commands from being executed.
4.  Excessive Permissions: An LLM plugin has permissions on other
    systems that are not needed for the intended operation of the
    application. E.g., a plugin intended to read data connects to a
    database server using an identity that not only has SELECT
    permissions, but also UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE permissions.
5.  Excessive Permissions: An LLM plugin that is designed to perform
    operations on behalf of a user accesses downstream systems with a
    generic high-privileged identity. E.g., a plugin to read the current
    user's document store connects to the document repository with a
    privileged account that has access to all users' files.
6.  Excessive Autonomy: An LLM-based application or plugin fails to
    independently verify and approve high-impact actions. E.g., a plugin
    that allows a user's documents to be deleted performs deletions
    without any confirmation from the user.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

The following actions can prevent Excessive Agency:

1.  Limit the plugins/tools that LLM agents are allowed to call to only
    the minimum functions necessary. For example, if an LLM-based system
    does not require the ability to fetch the contents of a URL then
    such a plugin should not be offered to the LLM agent.
2.  Limit the functions that are implemented in LLM plugins/tools to the
    minimum necessary. For example, a plugin that accesses a user's
    mailbox to summarise emails may only require the ability to read
    emails, so the plugin should not contain other functionality such as
    deleting or sending messages.
3.  Avoid open-ended functions where possible (e.g., run a shell
    command, fetch a URL, etc.) and use plugins/tools with more granular
    functionality. For example, an LLM-based app may need to write some
    output to a file. If this were implemented using a plugin to run a
    shell function then the scope for undesirable actions is very large
    (any other shell command could be executed). A more secure
    alternative would be to build a file-writing plugin that could only
    support that specific functionality.
4.  Limit the permissions that LLM plugins/tools are granted to other
    systems to the minimum necessary in order to limit the scope of
    undesirable actions. For example, an LLM agent that uses a product
    database in order to make purchase recommendations to a customer
    might only need read access to a 'products' table; it should not
    have access to other tables, nor the ability to insert, update or
    delete records. This should be enforced by applying appropriate
    database permissions for the identity that the LLM plugin uses to
    connect to the database.
5.  Track user authorization and security scope to ensure actions taken
    on behalf of a user are executed on downstream systems in the
    context of that specific user, and with the minimum privileges
    necessary. For example, an LLM plugin that reads a user's code repo
    should require the user to authenticate via OAuth and with the
    minimum scope required.
6.  Utilise human-in-the-loop control to require a human to approve all
    actions before they are taken. This may be implemented in a
    downstream system (outside the scope of the LLM application) or
    within the LLM plugin/tool itself. For example, an LLM-based app
    that creates and posts social media content on behalf of a user
    should include a user approval routine within the plugin/tool/API
    that implements the 'post' operation.
7.  Implement authorization in downstream systems rather than relying on
    an LLM to decide if an action is allowed or not. When implementing
    tools/plugins enforce the complete mediation principle so that all
    requests made to downstream systems via the plugins/tools are
    validated against security policies.

The following options will not prevent Excessive Agency, but can limit
the level of damage caused:

1.  Log and monitor the activity of LLM plugins/tools and downstream
    systems to identify where undesirable actions are taking place, and
    respond accordingly.
2.  Implement rate-limiting to reduce the number of undesirable actions
    that can take place within a given time period, increasing the
    opportunity to discover undesirable actions through monitoring
    before significant damage can occur.

### Example Attack Scenarios

An LLM-based personal assistant app is granted access to an individual's
mailbox via a plugin in order to summarise the content of incoming
emails. To achieve this functionality, the email plugin requires the
ability to read messages, however the plugin that the system developer
has chosen to use also contains functions for sending messages. The LLM
is vulnerable to an indirect prompt injection attack, whereby a
maliciously-crafted incoming email tricks the LLM into commanding the
email plugin to call the 'send message' function to send spam from the
user's mailbox. This could be avoided by: (a) eliminating excessive
functionality by using a plugin that only offered mail-reading
capabilities, (b) eliminating excessive permissions by authenticating to
the user's email service via an OAuth session with a read-only scope,
and/or (c) eliminating excessive autonomy by requiring the user to
manually review and hit 'send' on every mail drafted by the LLM plugin.
Alternatively, the damage caused could be reduced by implementing rate
limiting on the mail-sending interface.

## LLM09: Overreliance

### Description

Overreliance can occur when an LLM produces erroneous information and
provides it in an authoritative manner. While LLMs can produce creative
and informative content, they can also generate content that is
factually incorrect, inappropriate or unsafe. This is referred to as
hallucination or confabulation. When people or systems trust this
information without oversight or confirmation it can result in a
security breach, misinformation, miscommunication, legal issues, and
reputational damage.

LLM-generated source code can introduce unnoticed security
vulnerabilities. This poses a significant risk to the operational safety
and security of applications. These risks show the importance of
rigorous review processes, with:

-   Oversight
-   Continuous validation mechanisms
-   Disclaimers on risk

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  LLM provides inaccurate information as a response while stating it
    in a fashion implying it is highly authoritative. The overall system
    is designed without proper checks and balances to handle this and
    the information misleads the user in a way that leads to harm
2.  LLM suggests insecure or faulty code, leading to vulnerabilities
    when incorporated into a software system without proper oversight or
    verification.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Regularly monitor and review the LLM outputs. Use self-consistency
    or voting techniques to filter out inconsistent text. Comparing
    multiple model responses for a single prompt can better judge the
    quality and consistency of output.
2.  Cross-check the LLM output with trusted external sources. This
    additional layer of validation can help ensure the information
    provided by the model is accurate and reliable.
3.  Enhance the model with fine-tuning or embeddings to improve output
    quality. Generic pre-trained models are more likely to produce
    inaccurate information compared to tuned models in a particular
    domain. Techniques such as prompt engineering, parameter efficient
    tuning (PET), full model tuning, and chain of thought prompting can
    be employed for this purpose.
4.  Implement automatic validation mechanisms that can cross-verify the
    generated output against known facts or data. This can provide an
    additional layer of security and mitigate the risks associated with
    hallucinations.
5.  Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks and assign them to
    different agents. This not only helps in managing complexity, but it
    also reduces the chances of hallucinations as each agent can be held
    accountable for a smaller task.
6.  Clearly communicate the risks and limitations associated with using
    LLMs. This includes potential for information inaccuracies, and
    other risks. Effective risk communication can prepare users for
    potential issues and help them make informed decisions.
7.  Build APIs and user interfaces that encourage responsible and safe
    use of LLMs. This can involve measures such as content filters, user
    warnings about potential inaccuracies, and clear labeling of
    AI-generated content.
8.  When using LLMs in development environments, establish secure coding
    practices and guidelines to prevent the integration of possible
    vulnerabilities.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  A news organization heavily uses an LLM to generate news articles. A
    malicious actor exploits this over-reliance, feeding the LLM
    misleading information, and causing the spread of disinformation.
2.  The AI unintentionally plagiarizes content, leading to copyright
    issues and decreased trust in the organization.
3.  A software development team utilizes an LLM system to expedite the
    coding process. Over-reliance on the AI's suggestions introduces
    security vulnerabilities in the application due to insecure default
    settings or recommendations inconsistent with secure coding
    practices.
4.  A software development firm uses an LLM to assist developers. The
    LLM suggests a non-existent code library or package, and a
    developer, trusting the AI, unknowingly integrates a malicious
    package into the firm's software. This highlights the importance of
    cross-checking LLM suggestions, especially when involving
    third-party code or libraries.

## LLM10: Model Theft

### Description

This entry refers to the unauthorized access and exfiltration of LLM
models by malicious actors or APTs. This arises when the proprietary LLM
models (being valuable intellectual property), are compromised,
physically stolen, copied or weights and parameters are extracted to
create a functional equivalent. The impact of LLM model theft can
include economic and brand reputation loss, erosion of competitive
advantage, unauthorized usage of the model or unauthorized access to
sensitive information contained within the model.

The theft of LLMs represents a significant security concern as language
models become increasingly powerful and prevalent. Organizations and
researchers must prioritize robust security measures to protect their
LLM models, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their
intellectual property. Employing a comprehensive security framework that
includes access controls, encryption, and continuous monitoring is
crucial in mitigating the risks associated with LLM model theft and
safeguarding the interests of both individuals and organizations relying
on LLM.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1.  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a company's infrastructure
    to gain unauthorized access to their LLM model repository via
    misconfiguration in their network or application security settings.
2.  An insider threat scenario where a disgruntled employee leaks model
    or related artifacts.
3.  An attacker queries the model API using carefully crafted inputs and
    prompt injection techniques to collect a sufficient number of
    outputs to create a shadow model.
4.  A malicious attacker is able to bypass input filtering techniques of
    the LLM to perform a side-channel attack and ultimately harvest
    model weights and architecture information to a remote controlled
    resource.
5.  The attack vector for model extraction involves querying the LLM
    with a large number of prompts on a particular topic. The outputs
    from the LLM can then be used to fine-tune another model. However,
    there are a few things to note about this attack:
    -   The attacker must generate a large number of targeted prompts.
        If the prompts are not specific enough, the outputs from the LLM
        will be useless.
    -   The outputs from LLMs can sometimes contain hallucinated answers
        meaning the attacker may not be able to extract the entire model
        as some of the outputs can be nonsensical.
        -   It is not possible to replicate an LLM 100% through model
            extraction. However, the attacker will be able to replicate
            a partial model.
6.  The attack vector for ***functional model replication*** involves
    using the target model via prompts to generate synthetic training
    data (an approach called "self-instruct") to then use it and
    fine-tune another foundational model to produce a functional
    equivalent. This bypasses the limitations of traditional query-based
    extraction used in Example 5 and has been successfully used in
    research of using an LLM to train another LLM. Although in the
    context of this research, model replication is not an attack. The
    approach could be used by an attacker to replicate a proprietary
    model with a public API.

Use of a stolen model, as a shadow model, can be used to stage
adversarial attacks including unauthorized access to sensitive
information contained within the model or experiment undetected with
adversarial inputs to further stage advanced prompt injections.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1.  Implement strong access controls (E.G., RBAC and rule of least
    privilege) and strong authentication mechanisms to limit
    unauthorized access to LLM model repositories and training
    environments.
    1.  This is particularly true for the first three common examples,
        which could cause this vulnerability due to insider threats,
        misconfiguration, and/or weak security controls about the
        infrastructure that houses LLM models, weights and architecture
        in which a malicious actor could infiltrate from insider or
        outside the environment.
    2.  Supplier management tracking, verification and dependency
        vulnerabilities are important focus topics to prevent exploits
        of supply-chain attacks.
2.  Restrict the LLM's access to network resources, internal services,
    and APIs.
    1.  This is particularly true for all common examples as it covers
        insider risk and threats, but also ultimately controls what the
        LLM application "*has access to*" and thus could be a mechanism
        or prevention step to prevent side-channel attacks.
3.  Use a centralized ML Model Inventory or Registry for ML models used
    in production. Having a centralized model registry prevents
    unauthorized access to ML Models via access controls,
    authentication, and monitoring/logging capability which are good
    foundations for governance. Having a centralized repository is also
    beneficial for collecting data about algorithms used by the models
    for the purposes of compliance, risk assessments, and risk
    mitigation.
4.  Regularly monitor and audit access logs and activities related to
    LLM model repositories to detect and respond to any suspicious or
    unauthorized behavior promptly.
5.  Automate MLOps deployment with governance and tracking and approval
    workflows to tighten access and deployment controls within the
    infrastructure.
6.  Implement controls and mitigation strategies to mitigate and\|or
    reduce risk of prompt injection techniques causing side-channel
    attacks.
7.  Rate Limiting of API calls where applicable and\|or filters to
    reduce risk of data exfiltration from the LLM applications, or
    implement techniques to detect (E.G., DLP) extraction activity from
    other monitoring systems.
8.  Implement adversarial robustness training to help detect extraction
    queries and tighten physical security measures.
9.  Implement a watermarking framework into the embedding and detection
    stages of an LLMs lifecyle.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1.  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a company's infrastructure
    to gain unauthorized access to their LLM model repository. The
    attacker proceeds to exfiltrate valuable LLM models and uses them to
    launch a competing language processing service or extract sensitive
    information, causing significant financial harm to the original
    company.
2.  A disgruntled employee leaks model or related artifacts. The public
    exposure of this scenario increases knowledge to attackers for gray
    box adversarial attacks or alternatively directly steal the
    available property.
3.  An attacker queries the API with carefully selected inputs and
    collects sufficient number of outputs to create a shadow model.
4.  A security control failure is present within the supply-chain and
    leads to data leaks of proprietary model information.
5.  A malicious attacker bypasses input filtering techniques and
    preambles of the LLM to perform a side-channel attack and retrieve
    model information to a remote controlled resource under their
    control.
